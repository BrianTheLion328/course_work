        <h1>Southern Red Velvet Cake</h1>
        <h3>The Perfect Dessert for Valentine's Day!</h3>
        <p>This is a delicious red velvet cake recipe that was taught to me by my grandmother. Made with a light and
            buttery frosting instead of the usual cream cheese. It's a little time consuming but totally worth the
            effort!</p>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 C). Grease and flour three 10 inch round pans.</li>
        <li>Cream1/2 cup of shortening, 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, eggs, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and 1 teaspoon
            of butter flavored extract in a large bowl. Make a paste of cocoa and food coloring in a small bowl and add
            to shortening mixture. Pour in 2 1/2 cups flour alternately with the buttermilk, mixing until just
            incorporated. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt, baking soda, and vinegar in a small bowl, and while fizzing fold into
            the batter; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
            Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>To make frosting: Cook 3 tablespoons of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and milk in a skillet over low heat,
            stirring constantly, until thick. Let cool completely. Cream butter, 1 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup shortening in
            a separate bowl. Stir in 2 teaspoons each of vanilla extract and butter flavored extract. Then add flour
            mixture to bowl and cream together. Frost cooled cake.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Decorating Tips:</h2>
    <p>For best results, make sure the cakes are cooled before frosting them so you don't end up with a sloppy melted
        mess!</p>

    <ul>
        <li>After letting them cool, remove each cake from its pan and trim off the round tops to ensure even levels
            when stacking.</li>
        <li>Frost each layer with about 1/2 inch thick layer of frosting.</li>
        <li>Frost the side of the cake and the top of the cake evenly.</li>
        <li>When finished, you may add some strawberries, raspberries, cherries, or hershey kisses along the border of
            the cake for extra decoration and to help you space out slices when you serve.</li>
    </ul>
